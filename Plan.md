# Basic Concepts

The are absolute necessities; make sure to know it like the back of your palm.

- Understand the basic technique
- Describe it like you're describing it to someone else
- Know when to use it and what are its salient features that differentiates
  - This is important since many times even if you don't know the implementation by heart, just knowing in what situation what algorithm/data structure to use matters.
- Try to remember worst and best case complexities both with respect to time and space
- Code it up with comments and references

For every concept have a markdown written up and if coding it have source files along with the markdown in a separate directory.
